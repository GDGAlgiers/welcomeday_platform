# Developer documentation

This (work in progress) documentation provides a number of "how-to" guides explaining how to work on the WorkAdventure
code.

This documentation is targeted at developers looking to open Pull Requests on WorkAdventure.

If you "only" want to design dynamic maps, please refer instead to the [scripting API documentation](https://workadventu.re/map-building/scripting.md).
